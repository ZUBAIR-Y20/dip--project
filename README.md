# Image Filter App
This project focuses on an image filter application that allows users to apply various filters to their images. The app supports multiple filters, including Grayscale, Negative, Gaussian Blur, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Average, and Sobel. Users can browse an image, view the original and filtered images side by side, apply the desired filter, and download the final filtered image.

# Project Overview
This application provides an intuitive interface for applying different image filters. It is designed to help users quickly enhance their images with various effects.

# Features
Grayscale: Converts the image to shades of gray.
Negative: Inverts the colors of the image.
Gaussian Blur: Applies a Gaussian blur to the image, smoothing it.
Edge Detection: Detects the edges in the image using various techniques.
Thresholding: Converts the image to a binary image based on a threshold.
Average: Applies an averaging filter to smooth the image.
Sobel: Detects the gradient magnitude in the image, highlighting edges.
